              <h2>What does this website demostrate?</h2>

              <p>This is a demo website of The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-credential-management/">
              Credential Management API</a>.</p>

              <p><b>TL;DR</b> Use Credential Management API to get users sign-in without hassle</p>

              <h3>What is the Credential Management API?</h3>

              <p>To provide a
              sophisticated user experience, it's important to help users
              authenticate themselves to your website. Authenticated users can
              interact using a dedicated profile, sync data across devices,
              process data while offline, the list goes on and on. But creating,
              remembering and typing passwords tend to be cumbersome for end
              users which leads them to re-using same passwords on different
              sites. This of course entails a security risk.</p>

              <p>A new <a
              href="http://w3c.github.io/webappsec-credential-management/">Credential
              Management API</a> has landed behind a flag in Chrome 50. It's a
              standards-track proposal at the W3C that can store and retrieve
              user's credential information using JavaScript. You can
              incorporate the API's functionalities onto your existing website
              relatively easy, without making changes to your backend.</p>

              <p>There are 3 benefits for developers to implement the feature.
              </p>

              <ul><li>Enable users to sign in without typing passwords.
              <ul><li>Resume session automatically when user is signed out
              because of session expiration.</li></ul></li> <li>Help users
              remember the federated account of their choice and enable auto
              sign-in.</li> <li>Avoid saving invalid credentials upon failed
              authentication or password update</li></ul>

              <p>Here's how you can experience the benefits of using Credential
              Management API on this website.</p>

              <h2>Prerequisite</h2>

              <p>You can try out the Credential Management API on Chrome version
              later than 50 with
              <code>chrome://flags/#enable-credential-manager-api</code> flag
              turned on. Signed-in to Chrome profile is preferred.  </p>

              <h2>How to experience</h2>

              <h3>Step 1. Sign up</h3>

              <img src="/images/howto/sign-up.png" alt="" title="" />

              <p>Open the page, enter name, email address and password and sign
              up (Beware, even though password is stored encrypted, please don't
              enter real ones).</p>

              <h3>Step 2. Save password</h3>

              <img src="/images/howto/save-password.png" alt="" title="" />
              <p>You will then be signed-in and browser asks you to store
              credential information to the password manager. Tap "Save" to
              store the credential. <br /> You can find the saved credential
              information at <code>chrome://settings/passwords</code>.</p>

              <h3>Step 3. The first sign-in</h3>

              <img src="/images/howto/the-first-sign-in.png" alt="" title="" />

              <p>Reload the page. You should be signed-out because this demo
              site doesn't keep sessions. Not auto-signed-in? Don't worry, this
              is expected. Tap "Sign-In". <br /> You should see an account
              chooser dialog. Press the account you have just signed-up with.
              </p>

              <h3>Step 4. Opt-in to Smart Lock</h3>

              <img src="/images/howto/opt-in-to-smart-lock.png" alt="" title="" />

              <p>You should now see a dialog asking if you want to opt-in to
              Google Smart Lock. This will enable the feature to be turned on
              for other sites as well. You can turn this off manually by going
              to <code>chrome://settings/passwords</code>.</p>

              <h3>Step 5. Auto sign-in</h3>

              <img src="/images/howto/auto-sign-in.png" alt="" title="" />
              <p>Now, try reload the page again. You should now see at the
              bottom of the page that you are automatically signed-in using the
              account you have just signed-up with, as you have turned on the
              feature.</p>

              <h3>Step 6. Sign out to enable the "mediation mode"</h3>

              <p>By signing out from the site by clicking on "Sign Out" brings
              you back to a signed out state. Try reload the page. You will
              notice that you won't be automatically signed-in. This is called
              the "mediation mode". The mediation mode prevents you from
              automatically sign-in. It's usually turned on when a user signs
              out on purpose. <br /> By user proactively signing-in, the
              "mediation mode" will be turned off. Tap "Sign-In" again.</p>

              <h3>Step 7. Add second account</h3>

              <img src="/images/howto/add-second-account.png" alt="" title="" />

              <p>At this time, instead of choosing an account, tap "Cancel".
              This will show you a login modal dialog. Choose "Sign-In with
              Google" (registration and login using Google Sign-In don't make
              any difference on this demo site). <br /> A popup window should
              show up so you can sign-in by allowing profile access.</p>

              <h3>Step 8. Auto-sign-in with 2 accounts?</h3>

              <img src="/images/howto/auto-sign-in-with-2-accounts.png" alt=""
              title="" /> <p>Now you should be able to add the second account to
              the site. Let's reload the page without signing-out and see what
              happens? <br /> OK, you are not automatically signed-in. This is
              because you have more than 1 account saved to the website. In this
              case, users have to explicitly tap on "Sign-In" and choose an
              account to sign-in with.</p>

              <h3>Step 9. Try on different device</h3>

              <p>Now switch your device if you are signed-in to Chrome using a
              Google account. It could be another PC, Chromebook or another
              Android device - anywhere Google Chrome can run with the same
              profile.</p>

            </div>
